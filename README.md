Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Christopher Deo. I'm a Software and App Developer specializing in Front End Development.


Here's a fun fact about me:

🔥 I caught fire coding! 🔥 

OK, so not literally, 
but now that I've got your attention...🤣

I always thought my dream was to be an author, sipping my coffee and occasional mocha latte in my favorite coffee shop while drafting the opening lines to the next best-selling historical action novel. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my creativity, skill and love of writing. But, life had other plans!

Although I earned my B.S. degree in Management & Human Relations, I've always gravitated toward traditionally blue-collar positions and even started my own contracting and trucking businesses. But I kind of just felt meh. Like something was missing.  I yearned to learn and do more, yearned to learn something different.  And that's when it happened, the spark I had been missing reignited the instant I started to learn about software development.  I had learned a little bit about programming years ago when BASIC-A and DOS were the norm.  The years passed and my focus shifted.  I went about developing and imporving my business skills while letting my coding take a back seat. But then I discovered digital marketing built my first modern website.  Up to that point, I had only been a web consumer, but now I was encroaching on the development side of things and I was hooked!  That first site was built on WordPress. As my skills and knowledge increased, I discovered my current and favorite language, JavaScript. I mean seriously, how could it not be the greatest when it's named after my two favorite things, ☕️ coffee and 🧑🏽‍💻 coding!  Since then, I just can't get enough!  I'm constantly on the lookout for new libraries, frameworks, and languages to implement in my projects and add to my knowledge base!

Front-end web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break things (call me Wrek IT Ralph!🤣)to find ways to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course). I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying being able to look back on the day and say "I built /helped build that...". I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact. 

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, domain driven design, and responsive design principles. So far I have JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, U.I libraries such as Material UI, and version control using Git/GitHub under my belt and I'm in the process of adding Back End Technologies to the list. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto Front End Frameworks, Libraries, and any other programming languages, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head 🧠.
